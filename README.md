# Chatbot-Rule-Based-
A chatbot is a computer program that's designed to simulate human conversation.

There are broadly two variants of chatbots, Rule-based and Self-learning.
A rule-based bot uses some rules on which it is trained, while a self-learning bot uses some machine-learning-based approach to chat.
